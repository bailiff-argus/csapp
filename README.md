# Computer Science: A Programmer's Perspective. Some of the solutions

This repo is mostly so that I can work on the tasks from different machines,
but I'll be glad if it ends up being helpful to someone.

The structure is fairly simple: a top-level folder for a chapter,
and either files or folders for tasks within that chapter.
No makefiles (yet), I just set up a command to compile stuff like this:

```bash
gcc -Og -g -Wall -Wextra -Werror [-c] source.c
```
