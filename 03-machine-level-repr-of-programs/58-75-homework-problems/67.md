**A.** Eval stores the struct s at the top of the stack.
**B.** Eval passes the argument struct s on the top of the stack,
and provides a pointer to the return struct r, also allocated on the stack.
**C.** Process accesses both structures by their addresses.
**D.** Process writes the values of the fields by their offsets into the stack area taken by the return struct.
**E.** Eval accesses the same fields with the same technique, adjusting the offsets as necessary.
**F.** Structures are passed as addresses, modified in memory, and returned as addresses as well.
